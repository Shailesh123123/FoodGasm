# FoodGasm
FoodGasm is a full stack web application created to cater to the sole means of providing information about the hotels/resturaunts that are present within Boston and the sorrounding areas with their ratings, location and cuisine respectively so as to help people prioritize their visits as well as add comments as means of feedback for these resturaunts.

FoodGasm basically has two functionalities that includes the user/customer and the admin, the customer can view login, register, view the details of the resturaunts on the basis of the location as well as add comments for the respective resturaunts that they visited.

The admin can login,register, add new resturaunts/hotels as well as add any new job opportunities to the cart.

The REST api testing was carried out using the Insomnia tool.

The front end of the application is coded using angular-js, while the back-end has been coded using node-js. The database used here is Mongo db, while mongoose js has been used to provide a rigorous modeling environment for the data.
